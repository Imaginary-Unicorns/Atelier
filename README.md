# Atelier

Project Atelier comprises a complete redesign of the retail portal designed to address this concern and modernize the site.
The initial release will focus on providing the minimum viable product for our retail application. Features implemented will be constrained to the client experience which enables customers to search, browse, add to cart, and checkout. Maintenance of the catalog and internal systems are not in scope for this project.

## Team Objective
Deliver a fully functional web application that meets the specifications and requirements outlined by project stakeholders. Work together on a single code base by dividing up the work among team members but working collaboratively to produce a single front end application. Integrate your front end with the existing API for the product, and demonstrate your working application at the end of the project timeline.
